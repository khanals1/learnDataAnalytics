Here predictive analysis model to detect premature discharge of patients from the hospital is 
described in detail. 

Health Institute loose millions due to readmission of patients discharged prematurely. A model is 
developed to predict these patients. This model will be used by doctors to identify such patients and 
reduce the risk of premature discharge.

A dataset of 10000 patient shared by hospital was used to train and test the model.

Methodology 

Data is provided from the Hospital; hence data collection was not performed.
Firstly, the collected data was preprocessed to remove unnecessary details and make data uniform.
Data was then visualized in a form of pie chat to analyze the skewness of the data.
Apriori algorithm was then used to discover interesting patterns in the data and to establish relationship 
between different variables.
Provided data is then split into test and train data and three predictive algorithm: Decision Tree, 
Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes and Logistic Regression is used for prediction and their effectiveness is further 
analyzed.
